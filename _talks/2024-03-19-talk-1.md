## Using Ecotrons to separate the effects of above and belowground drought
Global climate change, especially drought, weakens grassland ecosystem functions. To Separate the effects of air and soil drought on grassland plants, we utilized the NPEC Ecotron facility to disentangle the effects of aboveground and belowground drought on the aboveground and belowground functional traits of grassland plants grown as mono- or polycultures. The results will advance our understanding of biodiversity and drought impacts on grassland ecosystems.
